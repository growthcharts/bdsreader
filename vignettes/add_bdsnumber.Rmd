## Note to developer

This vignette contains a list of actions needed to add a new BDS number to `read_bds()` and `write_bds()`. 

## List

Suppose we wish to support BDS number 16 (postal code) for reading from and writing to JSON.

1. Add the BDS number to latest JSON Schema file in `inst/schemas`. Set the type of field ("number", "character", "category", "integer") and set any restrictions needed on the values or the range. Keep the version number, and only increment it if a change alters existing entries. Try to adhere to BDS sequence.
2. In `convert_raw_df()`, assign the number to the appropriate type.
3. In `make_target()`, add the receiving field to the data template.
4. In `convert_checked_list_3()`, define the appropriate code to read the data value from the internal `bds` structure
5. In `as_bds_clientdata_v3()` define the way how to export the field from to R data object
6. Create a test file that includes a value for the new BDS field.
7. Rebuild package and try `q <- read_bds(fn)` where `fn` refers to your test file.
8. Try `write_bds(q)` and inspect the result.

If a new JSON Schema version is needed, then add it to `set_schema()`, increase JSON `"Format"` field, and add it to switch statemen in `write_bds()`.
